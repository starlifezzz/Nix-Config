# key-cli machine protocol

`key-cli` owns the machine-facing JSON emitted by the `key` command. This document
describes the stable external contract consumed by Clavis. A breaking response change
requires updates here and a corresponding public-contract test; Python module layout and
function names are not part of the protocol.

## Envelope

JSON output is requested with `--json` or `--format json` where the command supports the
latter. Responses contain these common fields:

- `schemaVersion`: integer, currently `1`;
- `command`: the public operation name, such as `record.status` or `clipboard.list`;
- `ok`: boolean matching whether the command succeeded;
- `error`: `null` on success, otherwise an object with at least `code` and `message`;
- `exitCode` may be present when a delegated process has its own result code.

Consumers must reject an unknown `schemaVersion` instead of guessing field meanings. Error
objects may include a `details` mapping with command-specific information.

## Commands and state

The stable command names currently exposed by JSON responses are:

- `version` and `doctor` for metadata and dependency diagnostics;
- `shell.start`, `shell.kill`, `shell.log` and `shell.ipc` for Quickshell lifecycle actions;
- `ipc.show` and `ipc.call` for public Quickshell IPC forwarding;
- `record.start`, `record.status`, `record.pause`, `record.resume` and `record.stop`;
- `audio.start`, `audio.status` and `audio.stop`;
- `clipboard.status`, `clipboard.list`, `clipboard.inspect`, `clipboard.restore`,
  `clipboard.delete`, `clipboard.clear`, `clipboard.watch` and `clipboard.store`.

Recording and audio responses include a versioned state object. Stable state fields include
`state`, `sessionId`, `pid`, `processStartTicks`, `processStartedAtMs`, `startedAtMs`,
`completedAtMs`, `updatedAtMs`, `temporaryPath`, `outputPath` and `error` when applicable.
The recording command additionally reports `type`, `target`, `fps` and `audio`; audio
reports the selected source and final duration when available. Paths are external paths,
not implementation-specific temporary object names.

Clipboard responses report the selected operation, dependency/capability information,
watcher state and, for entries, the stable `id`, MIME/payload classification and decoded
metadata. Binary payload data is not embedded in the normal JSON response.

## Exit codes

The process exit code is part of the contract:

- `0`: success;
- `1`: general backend failure;
- `2`: usage or argument error;
- `3`: required dependency unavailable;
- `4`: another recording/session operation is active;
- `5`: invalid or unavailable saved state;
- `6`: recorder failed to start;
- `7`: recorder failed to stop safely;
- `8`: recording/audio post-processing failed.

The JSON `ok` value and the exit code must agree. Dependency and state errors still return
the standard envelope so callers can report a useful error without parsing human text.
